# Contributing to Deep Draken

We are very open to community contributions and appreciate anything that improves `Deep Draken`! This includes fixings typos, adding missing documentation, fixing bugs or adding new features.
To avoid unnecessary work on either side, please stick to the following process:

1. Check if there is already [a related issue](https://github.com/DevavratSinghBisht/deepdraken/issues).
2. Open a new issue to start a quick discussion. Some features might be a nice idea, but don't fit in the scope of Deep Draken and we hate to close finished PRs!
3. Create a pull request in an early draft version and ask for feedback. If this is your first pull request and you wonder how to actually create a pull request, checkout [this manual](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

## Formatting of Pull Requests

Please give a concise description in the first comment in the PR that includes: 
- What is changing?
- Why? 
- What are limitations?
- Breaking changes (Example of before vs. after)
- Link the issue that this relates to
